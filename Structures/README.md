The database file is too large to include directly in the repository, but can be downloaded from the data repository [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3931013) doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3931013. Previously these data were available from the Structure directory using the github large file storage extension, but bandwidth limitations limit the number of downloads that can occur, so we have mirrored the data to the Zenodo repository.
